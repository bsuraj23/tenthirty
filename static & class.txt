#Why and when we use static method.?

1. Static Method — @staticmethod

Does not take self or cls.

Behaves like a regular function, but lives inside the class’s namespace.

Cannot access instance variables or class variables directly.

Useful for utility/helper functions that are logically related to the class but don’t need instance or class data.
   
#When to use:

When you want a function inside a class but it doesn’t depend on instance or class data.

Example: validation, conversion, calculations.

#Why and when we use class method.?

2.Class Method — @classmethod

Takes cls (the class itself) as the first parameter.

Can access or modify class-level variables (shared by all instances).

Often used as alternative constructors or factory methods.

#When to use:

When you need to create or configure an instance in a special way.

When you need to work with class variables rather than instance variables.
