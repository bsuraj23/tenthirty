1.Explain how Python manages memory internally.
Ans: Python uses a private heap space to store all objects and data structures. The memory management is automatic, but works like this:

Reference Counting üßÆ
Each object keeps track of how many variables point to it.
When the count becomes zero, Python deletes (frees) that object.

Garbage Collector (GC) üóëÔ∏è
Some objects can create circular references (e.g., two objects pointing to each other).
Python has a garbage collector to find and clean up these unused objects.

Memory Pools (via Malloc) üíæ
Python doesn‚Äôt directly ask the OS for every small object.
Instead, it uses pools and blocks to manage memory efficiently.

2.What is the difference between `id()`, `hash()`, and `is` in Python?
Ans:id(object)
Returns the unique identity (memory address) of an object.
Always unique during the lifetime of the object.

Example:
a = [1, 2, 3]
print(id(a))   # e.g., 140123456789456

üîπ hash(object)
Returns a hash value (integer) for hashable objects (like int, str, tuple).
Used in dictionaries and sets for quick lookup.
Not available for mutable objects like lists or dicts.

Example:
print(hash("hello"))   # e.g., 123456789
print(hash(10))        # same value every run

üîπ is (operator)
Checks if two variables point to the same object in memory.
It compares identity, not value.

Example:
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]
print(a == b)  # True  (values are same)
print(a is b)  # False (different objects in memory)
 Table

Function /    Operator      	           Checks / Returns	             Example
id(obj)  	Unique memory             identity (address)	              id(10)
hash(obj)	Hash value               (for hash able objects)	          hash("abc")
is	   Same object in memory?            (True/False)	              a is b

3.How does Python‚Äôs garbage collector work?
Ans: Reference Counting (Primary mechanism)
Every Python object has a reference count (how many variables point to it).
When the reference count becomes zero, the memory is immediately freed.

Example:
import sys
a = [1, 2, 3]
print(sys.getrefcount(a))  # reference count > 1 (because of internal use in getrefcount)

b = a      # another reference
print(sys.getrefcount(a))  # count increases

del b      # remove one reference
print(sys.getrefcount(a))  # count decreases

ii. Garbage Collector (for circular references)
Problem: Sometimes objects reference each other ‚Üí their reference count never reaches zero.
Example:
class Node:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ref = None
a = Node()
b = Node()
a.ref = b
b.ref = a

iii. Generational Garbage Collection
Python divides objects into three generations:
Gen 0 ‚Üí new objects
Gen 1 ‚Üí objects that survived one collection
Gen 2 ‚Üí long-lived objects
Idea: Most objects die young (e.g., temporary lists, strings).
So Python checks young generations more often than old ones ‚Üí efficient.

iv. Manual Control (optional)
You can use the gc module to control garbage collection:
import gc

collect()        # Force garbage collection
gc.disable()        # Disable automatic GC
gc.enable()         # Enable it again

Python frees memory automatically.
Reference counting clears most objects.
Garbage collector handles circular references.
Generational GC makes it faster by focusing on young objects.

4.What are reference cycles, and how does Python handle them?
Ans: A reference cycle happens when two (or more) objects refer to each other, keeping their reference counts above zero ‚Äî even though they are no longer needed by the program.
Because of this cycle, reference counting alone cannot free them.

Example of a Reference Cycle
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.ref = None

a = Node(1)
b = Node(2)

a.ref = b   # a ‚Üí b
b.ref = a   # b ‚Üí a   (cycle created)

del a
del b


After del a and del b, the program has no variables pointing to these nodes.
BUT a points to b and b points to a.
Their reference counts never reach zero ‚Üí memory leak if unchecked.
 Python uses a cyclic garbage collector (gc module) in addition to reference counting:
Detection
The GC periodically scans objects.
If a group of objects only reference each other (but not from outside), they are considered unreachable.
Collection
These unreachable cycles are broken.
Memory is freed, even though reference counts never dropped to zero.
Generational GC (optimization)
Objects are divided into Gen 0, Gen 1, Gen 2.
The GC looks for cycles more frequently in younger generations (where cycles are most common).
Demonstration:
import gc

class Node:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ref = None

a = Node()
b = Node()

a.ref = b
b.ref = a   # cycle created

del a
del b

# Manually trigger garbage collection
unreachable = gc.collect()
print("Unreachable objects collected:", unreachable)


Output (varies):
Unreachable objects collected: 2

5.What is the difference between `deepcopy` and `pickle`?
Ans: Copy.deepcopy:
Purpose: Creates a new object that is a full independent copy of the original, including all nested objects.
Scope: Works only in memory (during program execution).
Use case: If you want a "fresh duplicate" of an object while your program is running.
example:
import copy

a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
b = copy.deepcopy(a)

b[0][0] = 99
print(a)  # [[1, 2], [3, 4]]  (unchanged)
print(b)  # [[99, 2], [3, 4]] (independent copy)
ii)pickle:
Purpose: Converts a Python object into a byte stream (serialization) and back (deserialization).
Scope: Allows saving objects to a file or sending them across a network, then restoring them later.
Use case: If you want to store or transfer Python objects.
import pickle

data = {"x": 10, "y": [1, 2, 3]}

# Serialize (save)
with open("data.pkl", "wb") as f:
    pickle.dump(data, f)

# Deserialize (load)
with open("data.pkl", "rb") as f:
    new_data = pickle.load(f)

print(new_data)  # {'x': 10, 'y': [1, 2, 3]}
Main Differences:
Feature               |       	deepcopy	         |                 pickle
Purpose	              |      Copy objects in memory	 |          Serialize/deserialize objects
Storage	              |       Temporary (RAM only)	 |       Can be saved to disk / sent over net
Output	              |      A new Python object	 |           Byte stream (or file)
Use case	      |      Duplicate objects safely	 |      Save/load objects across sessions

6.Explain the difference between shallow copy, deep copy, and assignment.
Ans: Assignment (=)
What it does: Just creates a new reference (alias) to the same object.
Effect: Both variables point to the same object in memory.
Changes: If you modify one, the other also changes.
example:
a = [1, 2, [3, 4]]
b = a   # assignment, no new object
i)Shallow Copy
What it does: Creates a new object, but the nested objects are still shared.
Effect: Top-level is copied, but inner references are not duplicated.
Changes:Changing outer object won‚Äôt affect the original.
Changing nested object will affect both.
b[0] = 99
print(a)  # [99, 2, [3, 4]]  (changed!)
print(b)  # [99, 2, [3, 4]]
Key Point: Assignment = same object, different names.
import copy

a = [1, 2, [3, 4]]
b = copy.copy(a)  # shallow copy

b[0] = 99         # top-level change ‚Üí independent
print(a)  # [1, 2, [3, 4]]
print(b)  # [99, 2, [3, 4]]

b[2][0] = 88      # nested change ‚Üí shared
print(a)  # [1, 2, [88, 4]]
print(b)  # [99, 2, [88, 4]]
Key Point: Shallow copy = new container, but inner objects shared.
iii)Deep Copy:
What it does: Creates a completely independent clone, including all nested objects.
Effect: Nothing is shared ‚Äî everything is duplicated.
Changes: Modifying one does not affect the other.
import copy

a = [1, 2, [3, 4]]
b = copy.deepcopy(a)  # deep copy

b[2][0] = 99
print(a)  # [1, 2, [3, 4]]  (unchanged)
print(b)  # [1, 2, [99, 4]] (independent)

Key Point: Deep copy = fully independent clone.
Quick Comparison:
Operation	   |    New Object?	|   Nested Objects Copied?    |    Independent?
Assignment	   |    ‚ùå No	        |        ‚ùå No	              |     ‚ùå No
Shallow Copy	   |    ‚úÖ Yes	        |        ‚ùå No (shared)	      |     ‚ùå Partial
Deep Copy	   |    ‚úÖ Yes	        |        ‚úÖ Yes	              |     ‚úÖ Fully

7.How are Python‚Äôs lists implemented internally?
Ans: i)Lists are dynamic arrays:
In CPython (the standard Python implementation), a list is not a linked list.
Instead, it‚Äôs implemented as a resizable array of pointers.
Each element in the list is a pointer to a Python object (since everything in Python is an object).
ii)Over-allocation (growth strategy):
Lists need to support fast appends without reallocating every single time.
So when you append, Python may allocate extra space in advance.
Example:
If a list of size 4 grows to 5, Python might allocate space for 8 elements internally.
This way, many future appends are O(1).
When it does run out of space, Python resizes by allocating a larger block and copying pointers over.
iii)Memory layout:
A Python list object has two parts:
Header structure (stores size, capacity, etc.)
Pointer array (stores references to actual Python objects)
iv)Operations complexity:
Because lists are dynamic arrays:
Indexing (nums[i]) ‚Üí O(1) (direct pointer lookup)
Appending (nums.append(x)) ‚Üí Amortized O(1)
Popping at end (nums.pop()) ‚Üí O(1)
Inserting/removing in middle ‚Üí O(n) (must shift elements)
Checking membership (x in nums) ‚Üí O(n)

8.How does Python implement dictionaries (hash tables)?
Ans: Basic idea:
A dictionary maps keys ‚Üí values.
Internally, Python uses a hash table:
Compute the hash(key).
Use that to decide where to store the key‚Äìvalue pair in a table (an array of "slots").
On lookup, re-compute the hash and go directly to the slot.
ii)Dictionary slot structure:
Each slot in the hash table stores:
The hash of the key
The key object itself
The value object
iii)Handling collisions:
Sometimes two keys produce the same hash. Python uses open addressing with probing:
If the chosen slot is full, it looks for the next available slot (linear probing with some tweaks).
This avoids linked lists or secondary structures.
iv)Resizing (growth strategy):
When the table gets too full (‚âà 2/3 full), Python resizes it to a bigger array (usually about double the size).
This ensures performance stays amortized O(1).
v)Insertion order preservation:
Since Python 3.6 (CPython), dicts preserve insertion order as an implementation detail.
From Python 3.7+, this became a language guarantee.
vi)Complexity
Operation	    |      Average	  |          Worst Case
Lookup d[k]	       |       O(1)	          |            O(n)
Insert d[k] = v	    |       O(1)                           |                    O(n)
Delete del d[k]	    |        O(1)                        |                           	 O(n)
vii)Memory layout:
A simplified CPython dictionary has two parallel arrays:
Index table: stores offsets to entries.
Entries array: stores (hash, key, value).

9.What is the difference between `OrderedDict` and a normal dict in Python 3.7+?
Ans: Key Differences (still relevant):
Feature	                  |           dict (3.7+)	                                     |                        OrderedDict
Order preservation	  |         Yes (insertion order)	                             |                      Yes (insertion order)
Reordering methods	  |     ‚ùå Not available	                                     |                    ‚úÖ Has move_to_end() to reorder keys
Equality check	          |    Order doesn‚Äôt matter (only key‚Äìvalue pairs must match)	     |          Order does matter (OrderedDict([("a",1),("b",2)]) != OrderedDict([("b",2),("a",1)]))
Performance	          |   Slightly smaller & faster (fewer features)	             |           Slightly more overhead (extra doubly-linked list under the hood)

10.How do you profile Python code for performance bottlenecks?
Ans: Ways to Profile Python Code
1. Quick Timing with time or timeit
For small snippets, use timeit (preferred, more accurate than time).
Good for micro-benchmarks.
2. Using cProfile (built-in profiler)
Standard way to profile full scripts/functions.
Shows how many times each function was called and how much time was spent.
Best for function-level bottlenecks.
3. Line-by-Line Profiling (line_profiler)
External tool (install: pip install line-profiler).
Profiles time spent on each line of a function.
Useful when you need fine-grained detail.
4. Memory Profiling (memory_profiler)
Checks where memory is being used (good for memory bottlenecks).
 Good for RAM-heavy programs.
5. Visualization with snakeviz
Makes cProfile output easier to understand.
Opens an interactive browser visualization of bottlenecks.

*Summary
Use timeit ‚Üí quick one-liners.
Use cProfile ‚Üí overall function-level performance.
Use line_profiler ‚Üí detailed line-by-line profiling.
Use memory_profiler ‚Üí track memory usage.
Use snakeviz ‚Üí visualize profiling results.

üîπ Concurrency, Parallelism & Async
11.What is the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)? Why does it exist?
Ans: The GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) is a mutex (lock) in CPython (the main Python implementation).
It ensures that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time, even on multi-core CPUs.
This means that multi-threaded Python programs don‚Äôt run in true parallel on multiple cores (for CPU-bound work).
without the GIL, this would be unsafe.
With the GIL, Python makes sure only one thread runs at a time, so internal data structures (like reference counts) don‚Äôt get corrupted.
*The GIL exists mainly for simplicity and performance in CPython‚Äôs memory model:
Memory management safety
CPython uses reference counting to track object lifetimes.
Every time an object is used, its reference count is incremented/decremented.
Without the GIL, multiple threads updating reference counts simultaneously would need fine-grained locks ‚Üí huge overhead.
Simplicity of implementation
The GIL makes the interpreter‚Äôs C code much simpler.
No need to add locks around every Python object access.
Performance trade-off
For single-threaded programs (the majority when Python was designed), the GIL actually makes things faster, because we avoid the overhead of lots of small locks.

*Consequences of the GIL
Good for I/O-bound programs
Threads waiting on I/O (e.g., network, disk) release the GIL ‚Üí another thread can run.
So multithreading is still useful for I/O-heavy tasks.
Bad for CPU-bound programs
Only one thread can execute at a time, so multiple threads don‚Äôt speed up computation.
Example: numerical computations, image processing, etc.
*Workarounds:
Multiprocessing (multiprocessing module): Uses multiple processes (each with its own GIL). ‚Üí True parallelism.
C extensions / NumPy: Heavy computation can release the GIL in C code, allowing parallel execution.
Alternative interpreters:
Jython / IronPython: No GIL (but slower adoption, different ecosystems).
PyPy: Still has a GIL, though research into STM (software transactional memory) has been ongoing.

12.Difference between **multithreading** and **multiprocessing** in Python.
Ans: | Feature              | **Multithreading**                             | **Multiprocessing**                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Execution model**  | Multiple threads, 1 process                    | Multiple processes                   |
| **Memory space**     | Shared                                         | Separate (isolated)                  |
| **Communication**    | Shared variables (with locks)                  | IPC (queues, pipes, shared mem)      |
| **Overhead**         | Low (lightweight)                              | High (full process per worker)       |
| **Best for**         | I/O-bound tasks (web scraping, network apps)   | CPU-bound tasks (data crunching, ML) |
| **Affected by GIL?** | ‚úÖ Yes (threads can‚Äôt run CPU work in parallel) | ‚ùå No (each process has its own GIL)  |

Use multithreading ‚Üí When tasks spend most time waiting (I/O-bound).
Use multiprocessing ‚Üí When tasks spend most time computing (CPU-bound).

13.When should you use `threading` vs `multiprocessing`?
Ans: | Task type                              | Use `threading`  | Use `multiprocessing`       |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| I/O-bound (network, disk, DB)          | ‚úÖ Yes            | ‚ùå Not needed                |
| CPU-bound (math, ML, image processing) | ‚ùå Limited by GIL | ‚úÖ Yes                       |
| Memory efficiency                      | ‚úÖ Lightweight    | ‚ùå Heavier (separate memory) |
| Easy data sharing                      | ‚úÖ Shared memory  | ‚ùå Need queues/pipes         |

Rule of Thumb:
If you are waiting on something ‚Üí threading.
If you are crunching numbers ‚Üí multiprocessing.

14.What is `asyncio` in Python? How does it differ from threads?
ans: asyncio is a library in Python for writing asynchronous, concurrent code using coroutines (async/await syntax).
It provides an event loop that runs tasks, handling I/O without blocking.
Main idea: Instead of running many threads, asyncio uses cooperative multitasking ‚Äî tasks voluntarily give up control when waiting (like on I/O).
| Feature               | **`asyncio`**                                                    | **Threads**                                             |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Concurrency model** | Single-threaded, cooperative (tasks yield control using `await`) | Pre-emptive (OS switches between threads automatically) |
| **Parallelism**       | ‚ùå No true parallelism (runs on one thread, one core)             | ‚ùå In Python, limited by GIL for CPU-bound code          |
| **Best for**          | I/O-bound tasks (network requests, DB calls, file I/O)           | I/O-bound tasks (also some parallelism in C extensions) |
| **Overhead**          | Low (no thread creation, context switching cheap)                | Higher (thread creation & context switching cost)       |
| **Synchronization**   | Less error-prone (tasks cooperate explicitly)                    | Needs locks, semaphores to avoid race conditions        |
| **Scalability**       | Handles **thousands** of concurrent tasks efficiently            | Threads don‚Äôt scale well past hundreds                  |

Use asyncio when you need to handle lots of I/O-bound tasks concurrently (e.g., web servers, web scraping, chatbots, APIs).
Use Threads if you have blocking libraries that don‚Äôt support asyncio.
Neither helps for CPU-bound tasks ‚Üí use multiprocessing instead.

15.How do coroutines differ from generators?
Ans: | Feature         | **Generators**                 | **Coroutines**                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Goal**        | Produce values (iteration)     | Consume values / perform async tasks |
| **Syntax**      | `def` + `yield`                | `async def` + `await` (modern)       |
| **Resumption**  | Resumed with `next()`          | Resumed with `await` or `.send()`    |
| **Typical use** | Lazy iteration, data pipelines | Concurrency (`asyncio`), event loops |
| **Direction**   | One-way (producer ‚Üí consumer)  | Two-way (can send/receive values)    |
Generator ‚Üí Like a water tap: you call next() to get the next drop of water.
Coroutine ‚Üí Like a cooperative worker: you can send tasks to it, and it tells you when it‚Äôs waiting/finished.

16.Explain the difference between `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` and `ProcessPoolExecutor`.
Ans: 1. ThreadPoolExecutor
Uses threads inside a single Python process.
Threads share the same memory space.
Limited by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) ‚Üí only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time.
Best for I/O-bound tasks (network requests, file I/O, database queries).
2. ProcessPoolExecutor
Uses separate processes, not threads.
Each process has its own Python interpreter and memory space.
No GIL limitation ‚Üí can run true parallel CPU-bound code across multiple cores.
More overhead than threads (process creation, inter-process communication).
Best for CPU-bound tasks (math-heavy computations, data processing, machine learning).
Runs CPU-heavy tasks in parallel across cores.

üîπ 3. Key Differences
Feature	                                       ThreadPoolExecutor	                                          ProcessPoolExecutor
Concurrency type	                            Threads	                                                       Processes
Memory	                                     Shared memory space	                                           Separate memory per process
Affected by GIL?	                   ‚úÖ Yes (not good for CPU-bound)	                                    ‚ùå No (true parallelism)
Overhead	                                Low (lightweight)	                                             High (process startup, IPC)
Best for	                                I/O-bound tasks	                                                         CPU-bound tasks
Data sharing	                            Easy (shared memory, global vars)	                                 Hard (need pickling to send objects)
üîπ 4. Analogy
ThreadPoolExecutor ‚Üí Like workers in the same office sharing the same desk space (fast communication but can‚Äôt all type at once due to the GIL).
ProcessPoolExecutor ‚Üí Like workers in different offices (can all work in parallel, but need phone/email to communicate ‚Äî slower setup).

‚úÖ Summary:
Use ThreadPoolExecutor for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., web scraping, file I/O).
Use ProcessPoolExecutor for CPU-bound tasks (e.g., heavy number crunching).

17.What is the difference between cooperative multitasking and preemptive multitasking?
Ans: Difference:
| Feature      | **Cooperative Multitasking**                   | **Preemptive Multitasking**                    |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Control**  | Tasks yield voluntarily                        | OS scheduler enforces switching                |
| **Risk**     | One task can block all others                  | No single task can block forever               |
| **Overhead** | Low (fewer context switches)                   | Higher (frequent forced switches)              |
| **Examples** | Python `asyncio`, old Mac OS, embedded systems | Python `threading`, modern OS (Linux, Windows) |
| **Best for** | I/O-bound tasks where tasks yield naturally    | General multitasking, CPU-bound work           |
Cooperative multitasking = tasks decide when to give up control (asyncio).
Preemptive multitasking = OS decides when to switch tasks (threads, processes).

18.Write an example of an async function that fetches data from multiple URLs concurrently.
Ans: use asyncio + aiohttp (an async HTTP client).
We create tasks for all URLs.
asyncio.gather runs them concurrently.
Instead of waiting for each request one by one, all run at once ‚Üí much faster.

19. What are race conditions and deadlocks? How can Python handle them?
Ans: Race Condition:
Happens when two or more threads/tasks access shared data at the same time, and the final result depends on who runs first.
Example: Two threads both try to update the same bank account balance ‚Üí result may be wrong.
Deadlock:
Happens when two or more threads wait for each other forever.

Example:
Thread 1 holds Lock A and waits for Lock B.
Thread 2 holds Lock B and waits for Lock A.
Both are stuck.
Always acquire locks in the same order.
Use threading.Lock(timeout=...) or asyncio.Lock (for async).
Or avoid shared state (use queues, multiprocessing).
Summary:
Race condition: Tasks/threads compete for the same data ‚Üí inconsistent results.
Deadlock: Tasks/threads wait forever on each other ‚Üí program stuck.
Python‚Äôs solution: Use threading.Lock, asyncio.Lock, or design programs to avoid sharing mutable state.

20.How does Python handle inter-process communication?
Ans: | IPC Method        | Use Case                                     |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Queue**         | Simple, thread/process-safe message passing  |
| **Pipe**          | Lightweight, two-way communication           |
| **Value / Array** | Share small fixed-size data (fast)           |
| **SharedMemory**  | Share large buffers/NumPy arrays efficiently |
| **Manager**       | Share complex Python objects (lists, dicts)  |
| **Files/Sockets** | Cross-platform, cross-language IPC           |

21. What are Python memory views?
Ans: A memoryview is a built-in object that lets you view and manipulate the underlying memory of another object (like bytes, bytearray, or array) without copying the data.
It acts like a "window" into the buffer of the object.
This saves memory and improves performance when handling large datasets (e.g., images, binary files, NumPy arrays).
example code:
data = bytearray(b"hello")
mv = memoryview(data)
sub_mv = mv[1:4]   # view of "ell"
sub_mv[0] = 88     # modifies original (88 = 'X')
print(data)        # bytearray(b'hXllo')
*Key Features
Zero-copy slicing ‚Üí mv[1:5] creates a new view, not a new object.
Supports multi-dimensional data (like matrices in NumPy).
Read/write access depends on the original object:
bytes ‚Üí read-only memoryview.
bytearray or array ‚Üí read/write memoryview.

use memoryview:
Efficiency: Avoids making unnecessary copies of large data.
Interoperability: Works with NumPy, PIL, and other libraries that use the buffer protocol.
Low-level access: Lets you peek into raw binary data directly.

22.What is the difference between `bytes`, `bytearray`, and `memoryview`?
Ans: Difference:
 | Feature               | `bytes`                 | `bytearray`              | `memoryview`                   |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **Mutable?**          | ‚ùå No                    | ‚úÖ Yes                    | Depends on underlying object   |
| **Copy on slice?**    | ‚úÖ Yes                   | ‚úÖ Yes                    | ‚ùå No (just a view)             |
| **Use case**          | Store fixed binary data | Modify binary data       | Work with data without copying |
| **Memory-efficient?** | Less (copies data)      | Less (copies on slicing) | Most efficient (zero-copy)     |
Analogy:
bytes ‚Üí A printed book üìï (cannot be changed).
bytearray ‚Üí A notebook üìí (you can erase and rewrite).
memoryview ‚Üí A magnifying glass üîç on the book/notebook (you see/edit data without making a copy).

23.How do you reduce memory usage for large datasets in Python?
Ans: Use Efficient Data Types
Built-in types (like lists, dicts) have overhead.
Prefer arrays (array.array) or NumPy arrays with smaller dtypes.
‚úÖ Saves memory by choosing the smallest dtype that fits your data
ii)Use Generators Instead of Lists:
Lists store all elements in memory.
Generators compute values on the fly.
Generators (and iterators) reduce memory by avoiding storage of entire sequences.
iii)Use __slots__ in Classes:
By default, Python objects use a __dict__ to store attributes ‚Üí memory heavy.
Defining __slots__ removes this overhead.
Saves memory when creating millions of objects.
iv)Use Memory Mapping for Large Files:
Instead of loading an entire file into RAM, map it to memory and access parts as needed.
Useful for very large datasets (GBs).
v)Avoid Unnecessary Copies:
Python often makes copies when slicing or converting types.
Use memoryview for zero-copy slices.
vi)Chunk Data Processing:
Don‚Äôt load everything at once.
Process data in chunks (streaming).
Saves RAM by only holding part of the dataset in memory.
vii)Use Specialized Libraries:
numpy.memmap ‚Üí memory-efficient NumPy arrays for huge datasets.
dask ‚Üí parallel + out-of-core arrays/dataframes.
pandas.Categorical ‚Üí reduce memory for repeated strings.
viii)Garbage Collection and Object Reuse:
Delete unused variables: del var
Use gc.collect() to free cyclic references.
Reuse objects (e.g., array or pool of buffers) instead of creating new ones repeat


24.What are slots (`__slots__`) in Python classes, and why are they useful?
Ans: __slots__:
By default, Python stores instance attributes in a per-object dictionary (__dict__).
This dictionary makes attribute access flexible but also uses a lot of memory.
If you know exactly what attributes your class will have, you can declare them in __slots__.
Doing so tells Python not to use __dict__ but instead use a compact fixed structure.
Every instance has a dictionary (__dict__) ‚Üí flexible but memory-heavy.
*__slots__ Useful:

Memory efficiency:

Removes the overhead of per-instance dictionaries.
Huge savings if you create millions of objects.

Faster attribute access:
Attribute lookup is slightly faster because Python doesn‚Äôt need to search in a dictionary.

Prevents accidental attributes:
You can‚Äôt assign new attributes that aren‚Äôt in __slots__.
üîπ Limitations of __slots__
No __dict__ ‚Üí can‚Äôt add new attributes dynamically.
No __weakref__ unless you include "__weakref__" in __slots__.
Doesn‚Äôt play nicely with multiple inheritance unless all parent classes define __slots__.
üîπ Analogy
Without __slots__ ‚Üí every object carries a backpack full of pockets (the __dict__), ready to store anything.
With __slots__ ‚Üí every object has a slim wallet with fixed slots (only x, y, etc.) ‚Üí lighter, faster, but less flexible.
 
25.How do you implement an LRU cache manually?
Ans: An LRU (Least Recently Used) cache keeps a limited number of items, and when it‚Äôs full, it discards the least recently used one.
it can implement it manually using a combination of a dictionary (for O(1) lookup) and a doubly linked list (for O(1) updates of usage order).
it Works:
Dictionary (cache) ‚Üí O(1) access to nodes.
Doubly Linked List (head ‚Üî tail) ‚Üí O(1) updates of "most/least recently used" order.
On get() or put(), the accessed node is moved to the front (most recent).
When full, the last node (before tail) is evicted.

26.How does Python‚Äôs `functools.lru_cache` work internally?
Ans:functools.lru_cache is essentially a dict + LRU tracking (doubly linked list) wrapped around your function. It stores results for fast lookup and evicts the least recently used items when full, all with minimal overhead.
functools.lru_cache is a decorator that caches the results of a function.
lru_cache:
When the decorated function is called:
If the arguments are already cached, it returns the cached result. ‚úÖ
If not, it computes the result, stores it in the cache, and may evict the least recently used item if the cache is full.
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=3)
def fib(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

27.What are weak references (`weakref`) in Python?
Ans: Normally, when you assign an object to a variable, Python increases its reference count.
The object is kept alive as long as there‚Äôs at least one reference.
Weak references allow you to reference an object without increasing its reference count.
If the object is deleted (no strong references remain), the weak reference automatically becomes None or triggers a callback.
*Use Weak References:
Prevent memory leaks by avoiding circular references.
Useful in caching, memoization, or observer patterns where you don‚Äôt want to force objects to stay alive.
Let you track objects without owning them.

Strong reference ‚Üí You own a house key ‚Üí the house can‚Äôt be destroyed.
Weak reference ‚Üí You have a copy of the key but don‚Äôt own the house ‚Üí if the owner leaves, the house can be demolished, and your key becomes useless.

28.How do you debug a memory leak in Python?
Ans: Signs of a Memory Leak
Memory usage of your Python process keeps growing over time.
Objects that should be deleted are still accessible.
Sluggish performance or crashes in long-running programs.
 2. Common Causes
Global variables holding references
Unclosed files or network connections
Circular references with __del__ methods (garbage collector can‚Äôt handle them)
Caching without eviction (e.g., dict grows indefinitely)
Third-party library objects not released properly
3.Debugging Approach:
Observe memory growth using psutil or system monitor.
Use tracemalloc to find which lines allocate the most memory.
Use gc or objgraph to find objects still alive.
Check for references: circular references, globals, caches.

Fix leaks:
Remove unnecessary references.
Use weak references for caches (weakref).
Close files, sockets, database connections.
Avoid circular references with __del__.

29.What are the trade-offs between generators and lists for memory efficiency?
Ans: | Feature              | **List**                                          | **Generator**                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Storage**          | Stores all items in memory at once                | Generates items **on-the-fly**, does **not store** them |
| **Memory footprint** | Large for big datasets                            | Very small, almost constant                             |
| **Example**          | `[x*x for x in range(10**7)]` ‚Üí huge memory usage | `(x*x for x in range(10**7))` ‚Üí tiny memory usage       |

Generators = memory-efficient, lazy, single-pass, no random access.
Lists = higher memory usage, fast access, reusable, convenient.
Trade-off: memory vs speed/reusability.

30.How do you handle huge data (GBs) efficiently in Python?
Ans: Handling huge datasets (GBs or more) in Python requires careful strategies to avoid running out of memory and to process data efficiently. 
*Use Generators and Iterators:
Don‚Äôt load the entire dataset into memory at once.
Use generators (yield) or iterator-based APIs.
*Chunk Processing:
Process data in smaller chunks instead of all at once.
Works with Pandas, CSV, or database queries.
*Memory-Mapped Files:
Use mmap or NumPy‚Äôs memmap to access parts of a large file without loading it fully.
*Efficient Data Types:
Use smaller numeric types (e.g., int8, float32) instead of default Python types.
Use categorical types for repeated strings in Pandas.
*Out-of-Core Libraries:
Dask ‚Üí for parallel and out-of-core computations like Pandas.
Vaex ‚Üí for memory-efficient large DataFrame processing.
PySpark ‚Üí for distributed big data.
*Use Databases for Storage:
Store huge data in SQLite, PostgreSQL, or NoSQL instead of memory.
Query only what you need.
*Avoid Unnecessary Copies:
Use memoryview or NumPy views instead of copying arrays.
Be mindful of Pandas copies (.copy() creates new memory).
*Garbage Collection & Object Cleanup
Explicitly delete large temporary objects with del obj.
Call gc.collect() for long-running processes.
*Parallel & Lazy Processing
Use multiprocessing or Dask for CPU-heavy tasks.
Combine with chunking and generators.
