difference b/w swagger UI and ReDoc
>>Swagger UI

.Interactive documentation.
.Lets you try out API endpoints directly from the browser.
.Easy to test requests and see responses.
.More developer-friendly for quick testing.Use Swagger UI (/docs) when building & testing your API.
.Use ReDoc (/redoc) when you want to share clean docs with others.



>>>ReDoc

.Focuses on clean, well-structured documentation.
.Better for readability and understanding API details.
.Not as interactive as Swagger (mainly for reference).
.More client-friendly (good for external API consumers).
.Use ReDoc (/redoc) when you want to share clean docs with others.
