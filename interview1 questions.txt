1. What are Python’s key features? Why is it called an interpreted language?

Key Features:

>Easy to learn and read: Python’s syntax is simple and close to English.
>Interpreted language: Python executes code line by line, without compiling into machine code.
>Dynamically typed: No need to declare variable types explicitly.
>Extensive libraries: Offers a vast collection of libraries for web development, data science, etc.
>Object-Oriented & Functional: Supports classes, inheritance, and functional programming features.
>Portability: Code written on one platform runs on others without modification.

Why interpreted?
>Python doesn’t compile to binary before execution.
>It reads and executes the code directly at runtime.
>Errors are detected line by line during execution.

3Explain indentation in Python. What happens if indentation is incorrect?
indentation means adding spaces at the beginning of a line to show that a group of code belongs together. Python uses this instead of {} like other languages.

Example:

if True:
    print("Hello")  # This line is inside the if block
print("Bye")       # This line is outside


If you don’t indent correctly, Python will give an error and stop running the program.

Example of wrong indentation:

if True:
print("Hello")  # ❌ Error!


So, always make sure the lines inside loops, functions, or conditions are indented properly.
