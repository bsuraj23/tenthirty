2. what is the difference b/w Fast API and Django ?

API - Application Program Interface 

FastAPI :
    It is a pythin web framework spcially made to build API's quickly and efficiently.
    It focuses on sending and recieving data's not HTML 
Example: Cloud Kitchen

Django :
    It is a full stack web framework 
    It helps to build a entire site Backend + Frontend without having to start from Scratch 
Example : a Fully furnished restaurent(Tradtional)


# real time Example

Django 🏠 (Full House)
Django is like renting a fully furnished restaurant:
Kitchen → Django ORM for database
Waiters → Authentication system (login, register)
Menu board → Templating engine
Manager → Admin panel for managing orders & menu items
Cash counter → Built-in form handling & payment integration support
All connected — you just start cooking and serving.
If your goal is to build the entire website — backend + frontend + admin — Django is great because it has everything built-in.
With FastAPI ⚡ (Cloud Kitchen)

FastAPI is like running a cloud kitchen:
You have a super-fast chef (FastAPI server) who only makes food.
You don’t have tables, menus, or waiters — you just make dishes and send them to delivery apps like Zomato/Swiggy (API clients).
You choose your own tools for database, payment, and authentication — nothing is forced on you.
If your goal is to only provide a backend API for:
A mobile app
A frontend built in React, Angular, or Vue
A microservice in a big system
Then FastAPI is perfect because it’s lightweight and extremely fast.

Simple takeaway:
Django → Full restaurant (you can serve customers directly through the site) 🍽
FastAPI → Cloud kitchen (only cooks & sends food to apps/websites) 📦
