# Can you access the code from child to parent class ?

No we cannot directly access a child class method or properties 
from a parech object unless the object is actually an instane of 
child class.

Why ?

When we create an object from the parent class python only gives
it access to what is defined in the parent ut doesn't count about it's
future children 

# can on class can have two add functions ?

Actutually no because it two functions in the same class have the same 
name only the last one will work the earlier one get over written.
- python doesn't support method called overloading like other languages
by default.
