#all function 

Imagine you have a bunch of light bulbs 💡, and you want to check:

all() → Are ALL the bulbs turned on?

If every single bulb is on, all() says True.

If even one bulb is off, all() says False.

any() → Is AT LEAST ONE bulb turned on?

If any bulb is on (even just one), any() says True.

If all bulbs are off, any() says False.


Example: Shopping List 🛒
all(): Do I have all the items? (Milk, Eggs, Bread)

✅ Milk, ✅ Eggs, ✅ Bread → True

✅ Milk, ❌ Eggs, ✅ Bread → False

any(): Do I have at least one item?

❌ Milk, ✅ Eggs, ❌ Bread → True

❌ Milk, ❌ Eggs, ❌ Bread → False
