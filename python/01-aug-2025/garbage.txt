# we are not specifically writing garbage collection in code when it will get activated ?

Ans: In python it automatically cleans the data so we no need to use manually. 
They are two scenario's 
->python by default it keeps tracking of all variables and the object when there
is no one is using it clean automatically.
-> When the count becomes zero then also it deletes the data 
ex:
a = [1,2,3,4]
b = a 
a = None 
b = None 
then it cleans the data 

We can manually clean the garbage collection using gc.collect function 

sample code:

import gc 

a = 100 
a = None

gc.collect() 
print("garbage is collected")
