1. Normal Method :
   This is the most common type of method. Itâ€™s defined inside a class and takes self as the first parameter. It can access or modify object (instance) data.

   Example:
   
   class Student:
    def show(self):
        print("This is a normal method")

   s = Student()
   s.show()

2. General Method  :
   There is no official term "general method" in Python â€” but sometimes people informally refer to:

   Either:
   A normal instance method (just a regular method),Or a method that performs general logic, not specific to instance or class.

   Example :
   
    class MathTools:
    def square(self, x): 
        return x * x

3. Abstract Method

    An abstract method is declared in an abstract base class, but it has no implementation. Any subclass must implement this method.

    Python uses the abc module to support abstract methods.

    Example :
    
    from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

    class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):  # ðŸ‘ˆ Abstract method
        pass

    class Circle(Shape):
    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * 5 * 5  # example value

    c = Circle()
    print(c.area())
