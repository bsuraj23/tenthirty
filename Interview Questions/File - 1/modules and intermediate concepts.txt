1)  Difference between **module and package** in Python?
-->Module-module is a single python file(.py), which contains functions, classes, variables.
eg: math.py is a module that provides math functions like sqrt, factorial, ceil, floor...
   -import math- by using this we can use functions in the code
-->Packages- package is a collection(folder) of related modules.
   -It must contains __init__.py file(even if empty) to be treated as package.
eg: numpy is a package with many modules inside
   -import numpy as np - we can perform many task using this package numpy in coding

2) What are **Python namespaces and scope** (LEGB rule)?
-->Namespaces- namespaces are the placeholders like a box(dictionary) that maps names(identifiers) to objects
eg: a=10 #here a is the namespace
LEGB rule - explains python search order
L- local namespaces - variables inside the function
E-Enclosing namespaces - variables from outer of the function(for nested functions)
G- Global namespace - variables which we can access every where it is in the top level of a module
B- Built-in namespaces - functions and exceptions that python provides(print, len, ValueError...)
-->Scope-Scope is where a variable can be accessed or modified within the code.
LEGB rule(Name resolution order):
L-Local- current function scope
E-Enclosing- for outer function's scope(for nested functions)
G-Global-module level scope
B-Built-in - python built in names

3)Explain **import vs from-import**.
-->import- imports the whole module/package
  -we must use module names as a prefix when accessing function/varables(like module.function name)
eg: import math
    print(math.sqrt(16))  # 4    here math is the module name must used in this.
-->from _ import _ - import specific name from modules like(function, variables, classes) into your current namespace
   - we can use them directly without module prefix
eg:  form math import sqrt
     print(sqrt(16))  # 4  here no need of use module - directly accessible

4)What is **virtual environment (venv)** in Python? Why is it needed?
-->Virtual environment is isolated workspace where you install and manage pytho packages independently of the system-wide python installations.
 -if we want to do different projects they need its own packges. if we installing packages globally(pip install...) can mess up system 
tools that relay on python. Virtual envirenment keeps everying safe.
eg:One Projects needs its own packages setup. Another project needs its own. If we do both in the same environment, things get messy- conflict can occur. So, virtual environment give each project its own environment. Thats why we needed virtual environment.

5) Difference between **shallow copy, deep copy, assignment operator**.?
-->Assignment operator- It doesnt copy the object , just creates  a new reference as to the same object and if we change in one it will reflect in another.
eg: #Assignment operator
list1=[1,2,[3,4]]
list2=list1         #assignment (no copy)
list2[0]=100
print(list1)     #[100,2,[3,4]]
-->Shallow copy - It creates a new object, but copies references of nested objects(not the objects themselves).
  -top level changes are independent, but nested objects are shared and changed.
eg:#shallow copy
import copy
list1=[1,2,[3,4]]
list2=copy.copy(list1)   #shallow copy
list2[0]=100
list2[2][0]=200
print(list1)           #[1,2,[200,4]]      nested list affected
print(list2),          #[100,2,[200,4]]
-->Deep copy- it creates new objects and recursively copies all nested objects.
  -Changes in one object donot affect in another unlike shallowcopy.
eg:#deep copy
list1=[1,2,[3,4]]
list2=copy.deepcopy(list1)      #deep copy
list2[0]=100
list2[2][0]=200
print(list1)            #[1,2,[3,4]]         unaffected
print(list2)            #[100,2,[200,4]]

6)Explain how **JSON** is handled in Python (`json` module).?
-->JSON(javascript object notation) is a lightweight data format for exchanging data between systems.
  -Looks like a python dictionary, but it is always a string.
eg:json
{
  "name":"Harish",
  "age":21,
  "skills":["Python","FastAPI"]
}
-->Python json module- Python provides the json module to encode(dump) and decode(load) JSON data.
  -JSON handling 
  1)converting Python to Json
 import json
python_dict={
  "name": "Harish",
  "age": 21,
  "skills": ["Python", "FastAPI"]
}
print("Converting python to json")
json_string=json.dumps(python_dict)    #Function: dumps or dump
print(type(python_dict),json_string,type(json_string),)   #if it is a string it is a json data, if it is a dict it is a python data

  2)converting JSON to python
  print("Converting JSON to pyhton")
json_strings='{"name": "Harish", "age": 23, "skills": ["Python", "FastAPI"]}'
python_dict=json.loads(json_strings)
print(type(json_strings),python_dict,type(python_dict))
