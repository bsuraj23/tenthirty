List - When you need ordered, mutable sequences with possible duplicates.

Set - When you need unique elements and fast membership checks.

Tuple - When you need an immutable sequence (e.g., dictionary keys).

Dict - When you need key-value pairs with fast lookups.


Insertion Order:

    List, Tuple, Dict - Maintain order.

    Set  No guaranteed order.

Duplicates:

    List & Tuple - Allow duplicates.

    Set & Dict keys - No duplicates (unique elements only).

Heterogenous Data:

    All support mixed data types (e.g., [1, "hello", 3.14]).

    Dict keys must be hashable (e.g., int, str, tuple; but not list or set).

Mutability:

    List, Set, Dict - Can be modified after creation.

    Tuple - Immutable (cannot change after creation).
