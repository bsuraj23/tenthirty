key features of an Operating System (OS)

1. Process Management

       Handles creation, scheduling, and termination of processes (running programs).

       Ensures multitasking by managing CPU time between processes.

2. Memory Management

       Manages RAM allocation to processes.

       Keeps track of each byte and avoids overlap.

       Handles virtual memory (using disk as extra RAM).

3. File System Management

       Organizes files in directories/folders.

       Handles reading, writing, deletion, and permissions.

       Supports file types and file systems (FAT, NTFS, ext4).

4. Device Management
   
       Manages input/output devices like keyboards, mice, printers, etc.

       Uses device drivers to communicate with hardware.

       Ensures efficient access and control over devices.

5. User Interface (UI)

       Provides a way for users to interact with the system.

       CLI (Command Line Interface): e.g., bash, cmd

       GUI (Graphical User Interface): e.g., Windows, macOS

6. Security and Protection
       
       Protects system from unauthorized access, viruses, and threats.

       Manages user authentication, file permissions, and encryption.

8. Networking
	
	Enables communication between systems over LAN, WAN, or Internet.

	Manages network protocols, sharing resources, and file transfers.

9. Resource Allocation
	
	Allocates CPU, memory, disk, and I/O devices to processes as needed.

	Ensures fair and efficient resource usage.

10. Error Detection and Handling

	Continuously monitors the system for hardware/software errors.

	Alerts users or takes corrective action.
